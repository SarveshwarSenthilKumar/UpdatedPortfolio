                                <p>First Installment of the Passion Projects developed by me in Grade 8. The purpose was to create a functioning and useful website that allows students to access relevant links in a more efficient manner. It also has a built-in game which was played by the class every day at the end of the day. There were two more installments to this series with Passion 2, being a personal goal where I learned <orange>Ja</orange><wb>va</wb>, and Passion 3 where I decided to tackle the challenge of creating Rock Paper Scissors, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Battleship. This website was presented in front of the entire school and was played by numerous students.</p>

The theme of the hackathon was to solve a <red>Canadian</red> <white>Issue</white>. Our project was a web application which connects the older generation to young individuals in order to help out with menial tasks such as shoveling snow off their sidewalks in exchange for volunteer hours as well as <careage>CareAge</careage> points which can be used to redeem different prizes. We decided to create the backend using the <flask>Flask</flask> module in <yellow>Py</yellow><blue>thon</blue> and coordinate it with a <blue>TypeScript/React</blue> frontend along with <sqlite3blue>SQLite3</sqlite3blue> for the databases, which can easily be migrated into <sqlite3blue>MySQL</sqlite3blue> in a professional production environment. In the end, while we may not have won the hackathon, I enjoyed my time there and learned valuable skills such as <blue>React, Docker</blue>, AI, Blockchain, Orkes Conductor, Vercel, as well as the power of collaboration.</p>

                                    <p>On March 21st, 2025 (21st to 23rd, 36-hour all-nighter), I decided to participate in my second ever hackathon; GenAI Genesis 2025, Canada's Largest AI Hackathon with over 2100 registrants, 600 hackers, and 160 projects. For this Hackathon, I had the opportunity to team up with Cayden Wong, Mahan Nourhosseinalipour, Tommy Yu. The theme and goal of this hackathon was to use AI for Human Empowerment. Our project was an improved email client which uses a specialized model to detect for spam and scam, while discarding of them accordingly. This would solve the evergrowing problem currently of malicious content online which are sent through emails such as phishing attacks. With our access to emails, we were also able to develop and incorporate additional functionality for users such as a built-in summary feature which can summarize the contents of your emails and provide personalized messages such as messages reminding you to reply or look at urgent emails, as well as a feature which allows the user to create a folder accompanied by a descriptor sentence allowing our AI model to categorize the emails into different folders based on similarity to the descriptor sentences. This project was built with a similar tech stack to some of my other projects, utilizing <flask>Flask</flask> in <yellow>Py</yellow><blue>thon</blue> for the backend, coordinating it with a <blue>TypeScript/React</blue> frontend, and <sqlite3blue>SQLite3</sqlite3blue> for databases. For our AI models, we used <cohere>Cohere</cohere>'s pre-made models and fine tuned prompts, however with extra time and resources, a definite future plan would be to have a local model for specialized and more accurate results as well as for privacy reasons.</p>

                                    <p>On April 3rd, 2025, I decided to participate in my third ever hackathon; EurekaHacks 2025, Canada's Largest High School Hackathon with over 300 registrants/hackers, and 50 projects. For this Hackathon, I had the opportunity to team up with Pranav Bailoor, one of my best friends, and fellow student of Port Credit Secondary School. The theme of this hackathon was Outdoors. In order to come up with an idea, we went outdoors into the real world and asked people on the street in the surroundings. Their answer was almost always that they want to go out but they do not know where to go, and if they do, it takes time which they do not have to plan out the trip. We developed the solution in 8 hours; Roamify, your perzonalized AI trip planner encouraging people to connect with their natural surroundings. We utilize the Google Maps API in order to find visitors attractions in a nearby area, and create an AI generated plan courtesy of Gemini, which is shown to the user. This project was built with a similar tech stack to some of my other projects, utilizing <flask>Flask</flask> in <yellow>Py</yellow><blue>thon</blue> for the backend, basic HTML and CSS for the frontend, with <span class="genai-genesis">Google Gemini</span>'s pre-made models and fine tuned prompts, however with extra time and resources, a definite future plan would be to have a local model for specialized and more accurate results, not to mention quicker and more efficient results, as well as for privacy reasons, another future plan would be to have better location tracking and to save the user's preferences in terms of location for training and personalization.</p>

                                <p>One of the best courses I opted to take in high school was Grade 11 Computer Engineering. This class taught me valuable technical skills thanks to the adventurous nature of building projects rather than pen and paper studying. In this class, we were had to install and use <mint>Linux</mint> as our main operating system and contribute to programming projects, which led us to learn the command line interface as well as the inner workings of <re>Git</re>. One of the best projects that I had the opportunity of working on was to develop a tachometer for a broken treadmill using an infrared sensor, an 8-bit display and an <arduino>Arduino</arduino>. This gave me a chance to work on my problem-solving skills as well as my coding skills which can be found on display with the link below.</p>

The theme of the hackathon was to solve a <red>Canadian</red> <white>Issue</white>. Our project was a web application which connects the older generation to young individuals in order to help out with menial tasks such as shoveling snow off their sidewalks in exchange for volunteer hours as well as <careage>CareAge</careage> points which can be used to redeem different prizes. We decided to create the backend using the <flask>Flask</flask> module in <yellow>Py</yellow><blue>thon</blue> and coordinate it with a <blue>TypeScript/React</blue> frontend along with <sqlite3blue>SQLite3</sqlite3blue> for the databases, which can easily be migrated into <sqlite3blue>MySQL</sqlite3blue> in a professional production environment. In the end, while we may not have won the hackathon, I enjoyed my time there and learned valuable skills such as <blue>React, Docker</blue>, AI, Blockchain, Orkes Conductor, Vercel, as well as the power of collaboration.</p>

                                <p>On March 21st, 2025 (21st to 23rd, 36-hour all-nighter), I decided to participate in my second ever hackathon; GenAI Genesis 2025, Canada's Largest AI Hackathon with over 2100 registrants, 600 hackers, and 160 projects. For this Hackathon, I had the opportunity to team up with Cayden Wong, Mahan Nourhosseinalipour, Tommy Yu. The theme and goal of this hackathon was to use AI for Human Empowerment. Our project was an improved email client which uses a specialized model to detect for spam and scam, while discarding of them accordingly. This would solve the evergrowing problem currently of malicious content online which are sent through emails such as phishing attacks. With our access to emails, we were also able to develop and incorporate additional functionality for users such as a built-in summary feature which can summarize the contents of your emails and provide personalized messages such as messages reminding you to reply or look at urgent emails, as well as a feature which allows the user to create a folder accompanied by a descriptor sentence allowing our AI model to categorize the emails into different folders based on similarity to the descriptor sentences. This project was built with a similar tech stack to some of my other projects, utilizing <flask>Flask</flask> in <yellow>Py</yellow><blue>thon</blue> for the backend, coordinating it with a <blue>TypeScript/React</blue> frontend, and <sqlite3blue>SQLite3</sqlite3blue> for databases. For our AI models, we used <cohere>Cohere</cohere>'s pre-made models and fine tuned prompts, however with extra time and resources, a definite future plan would be to have a local model for specialized and more accurate results as well as for privacy reasons.</p>

                                <p>On April 3rd, 2025, I decided to participate in my third ever hackathon; EurekaHacks 2025, Canada's Largest High School Hackathon with over 300 registrants/hackers, and 50 projects. For this Hackathon, I had the opportunity to team up with Pranav Bailoor, one of my best friends, and fellow student of Port Credit Secondary School. The theme of this hackathon was Outdoors. In order to come up with an idea, we went outdoors into the real world and asked people on the street in the surroundings. Their answer was almost always that they want to go out but they do not know where to go, and if they do, it takes time which they do not have to plan out the trip. We developed the solution in 8 hours; Roamify, your perzonalized AI trip planner encouraging people to connect with their natural surroundings. We utilize the Google Maps API in order to find visitors attractions in a nearby area, and create an AI generated plan courtesy of Gemini, which is shown to the user. This project was built with a similar tech stack to some of my other projects, utilizing <flask>Flask</flask> in <yellow>Py</yellow><blue>thon</blue> for the backend, basic HTML and CSS for the frontend, with <span class="genai-genesis">Google Gemini</span>'s pre-made models and fine tuned prompts, however with extra time and resources, a definite future plan would be to have a local model for specialized and more accurate results, not to mention quicker and more efficient results, as well as for privacy reasons, another future plan would be to have better location tracking and to save the user's preferences in terms of location for training and personalization.</p>

                        School Projects and CSN: This section is dedicated to school projects in which I utilized my programming expertise to put my own spin on assignments. As for the latter part of this section, I have attached projects which were connected to CSN or Camilla Senior Network which was an informative monthly presentation to the entire school where I was one of the hosts. I was responsible for all the software development for this project, such as the website, and I had the chance to showcase a lot of projects including the Passion 3 above and HackerLife below. CSN eventually developed and evolved into <span class="darkgreen">Re</span><span class="golden">Sourced</span>.

                        Computer Engineering: One of the best courses I opted to take in high school was Grade 11 Computer Engineering. This class taught me valuable technical skills thanks to the adventurous nature of building projects rather than pen and paper studying. In this class, we were had to install and use <span class="mint">Linux</span> as our main operating system and contribute to programming projects, which led us to learn the command line interface as well as the inner workings of <span class="re">Git</span>. One of the best projects that I had the opportunity of working on was to develop a tachometer for a broken treadmill using an infrared sensor, an 8-bit display and an <span class="arduino">Arduino</span>. This gave me a chance to work on my problem-solving skills as well as my coding skills which can be found on display with the link below.
