The theme of the hackathon was to solve a <red style="color:red;">Canadian</red> <white style="color: white;">Issue</white>. Our project was a web application which connects the older generation to young individuals in order to help out with menial tasks such as shoveling snow off their sidewalks in exchange for volunteer hours as well as <careage style="color: #316cb8;">CareAge</careage> points which can be used to redeem different prizes.

For this Hackathon, I had the opportunity to team up with Cayden Wong, Mahan Nourhosseinalipour, Tommy Yu. The theme and goal of this hackathon was to use AI for Human Empowerment. Our project was an improved email client which uses a specialized model to detect for spam and scam, while discarding of them accordingly. This would solve the evergrowing problem currently of malicious content online which are sent through emails such as phishing attacks. With our access to emails, we were also able to develop and incorporate additional functionality for users such as a built-in summary feature which can summarize the contents of your emails and provide personalized messages such as messages reminding you to reply or look at urgent emails, as well as a feature which allows the user to create a folder accompanied by a descriptor sentence allowing our AI model to categorize the emails into different folders based on similarity to the descriptor sentences. This project was built with a similar tech stack to some of my other projects, utilizing <flask style="color: rgb(0, 178, 178);">Flask</flask> in <yellow style="color: yellow;">Py</yellow><blue style="color: #4B8BBE;">thon</blue> for the backend, coordinating it with a <blue style="color: rgb(0, 178, 178);">TypeScript/React</blue> frontend, and <sqlite3blue style="color: #0073CF;">SQLite3</sqlite3blue> for databases. For our AI models, we used <cohere style="color: #1CAA96;">Cohere</cohere>'s pre-made models and fine tuned prompts, however with extra time and resources, a definite future plan would be to have a local model for specialized and more accurate results as well as for privacy reasons.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 5%; font-size: 1.5vw;">On April 3rd, 2025, I decided to participate in my third ever hackathon; EurekaHacks 2025, Canada's Largest High School Hackathon with over 300 registrants/hackers, and 50 projects. For this Hackathon, I had the opportunity to team up with Pranav Bailoor, one of my best friends, and fellow student of Port Credit Secondary School. The theme of this hackathon was Outdoors. In order to come up with an idea, we went outdoors into the real world and asked people on the street in the surroundings. Their answer was almost always that they want to go out but they do not know where to go, and if they do, it takes time which they do not have to plan out the trip. We developed the solution in 8 hours; Roamify, your perzonalized AI trip planner encouraging people to connect with their natural surroundings. We utilize the Google Maps API in order to find visitors attractions in a nearby area, and create an AI generated plan courtesy of Gemini, which is shown to the user. This project was built with a similar tech stack to some of my other projects, utilizing <flask style="color: rgb(0, 178, 178);">Flask</flask> in <yellow style="color: yellow;">Py</yellow><blue style="color: #4B8BBE;">thon</blue> for the backend, basic HTML and CSS for the frontend, with <span class="genai-genesis">Google Gemini</span>'s pre-made models and fine tuned prompts, however with extra time and resources, a definite future plan would be to have a local model for specialized and more accurate results, not to mention quicker and more efficient results, as well as for privacy reasons, another future plan would be to have better location tracking and to save the user's preferences in terms of location for training and personalization.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 5%; font-size: 1.5vw;">On May 16th 2025, I participated in my fourth hackathon experience; <span style="color: #d97ad9;">JamHacks 9</span>, Canada's New Largest High School Hackathon with over 200 registrants/hackers, and 60 projects. For this Hackathon, I teamed up with Devansh Goyal, a Grade 12 Student at Port Credit Secondary School this year, as well as Clare Chen, a Grade 10 at Laurel Heights Secondary School. The problem we decided to tackle was one which is quite prevalent and disturbing, especially in Canada and Ontario specifically. In Canada, 1 in 7 Emergency Room visits and can be solved in a general practice clinic, with more unaccounted for. This causes unnecessarily long wait times for something which is considered "emergency", this causes many Canadian citizens to travel to the US or other countries to receive the care they require for life. This is the problem my partners and I decided to solve this hackathon. We built CiviClinic, which is a platform which utilizes the raw power of <span style="color: #FF6B6B;">AI</span> as well as the authenticity of real doctors. It's a platform where patients can enter their symptoms or scan an image and receive tailored advice using our custom-built and trained <span style="color: #EE82EE;">machine learning models</span> for <span style="color: #9370DB;">image classification</span> as well as <span style="color: #9370DB;">Natural Language Processing</span>. In addition, users can also use our specialized map in order to find doctors, specialists, and general hospitals nearby using the <span style="color: #34A853;">Google Maps API</span>. We built this app using <span style="color: #EE4C2C;">PyTorch</span> for the <span style="color: #EE82EE;">Machine Learning models</span>, <span style="color: #003B57;">SQLite3</span> for the Databases, <flask style="color: rgb(0, 178, 178);">Flask</flask> in <yellow style="color: yellow;">Py</yellow><blue style="color: #4B8BBE;">thon</blue> for the backend and decided to take it slow with a vanilla <span style="color: #E34C26;">HTML</span>, <span style="color: #2965F1;">CSS</span>, and <span style="color: #F0DB4F;">JS</span> frontend.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 5%; font-size: 1.5vw;">
                On July 4th, 2025, I participated in my fifth ever hackathon; <span style="color: #008B8B; font-weight: bold;">Hack404</span>, a hackathon held by the Power Unit Youth Organization at University of Toronto's Myhal Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship with more than 220 participants and 45 projects submitted. For this hackathon, I teamed up with Devansh Goel, Farhan Naeem, and Yichen Xiao. We decided to build <span style="color: #3CB371; font-weight: bold;">Sweepify</span>, the <span style="color: #FF0000;">Pokemon GO</span> for <span style="color: #8B4513;">Trash</span> where one man's trash is another man's treasure. We built an app where users can upload an image of a dirty and trashy area onto our platform where we will use a machine learning model to give it a score of dirtiness, the higher the score the more trash. This picture will then be posted to a map where other users can clean up the trash, send in an after picture and be rewarded points for their service. These points can then be redeemed for prizes like gift cards, donations, sustainable items and so on. Another aspect of this app in terms of incentives is that we have a daily streak as well as friend nominations, a similar idea to <span style="color: #FFD700;">Snapchat</span> but for trash collection. We have numerous factors for verification to make sure that the users are not gaming the system such as <span style="color: #4169E1;">GPS tracking</span> of the user, a <span style="color: #FF6347;">30 minute cooldown</span>, a mandatory verification of cleanup, as well as an <span style="color: #8B0000;">ID required for sign up</span>. We also have additional features where users can schedule events such as a <span style="color: #9932CC;">mass cleanup</span>, as well as a <span style="color: #FF0000;">heatmap</span> of local hotspots which utilizes the <span style="color: #20B2AA;">OpenAI API</span> to scrape for recent hotspots. In order to develop this app, we utilized <span style="color: #61DAFB;">React</span>, <span style="color: #3178C6;">TypeScript</span>, and <span style="color: #38B2AC;">Tailwind CSS</span> for the frontend, <span style="color: #FFA500;">Firebase</span> for the databases, <span style="color: #000000;">Flask</span> for the backend and a variety of <span style="color: #4B0082;">APIS</span> such as the <span style="color: #4285F4;">Google Maps API</span>, <span style="color: #FF6B6B;">Roboflow API</span>, and <span style="color: #20B2AA;">OpenAI API</span>.

                <p style="margin-left: 5%; font-size: 1.5vw;">One of the best courses I opted to take in high school was Grade 11 Computer Engineering. This class taught me valuable technical skills thanks to the adventurous nature of building projects rather than pen and paper studying. In this class, we were had to install and use <mint style="color: #86BE43;">Linux</mint> as our main operating system and contribute to programming projects, which led us to learn the command line interface as well as the inner workings of <re style="color: #f14e32;">Git</re>. One of the best projects that I had the opportunity of working on was to develop a tachometer for a broken treadmill using an infrared sensor, an 8-bit display and an <arduino style="color: rgb(0, 183, 169);">Arduino</arduino>.

            <p style="margin-left: 5%; font-size: 1.5vw;">On February 21st, 2025 (21st to 23rd, 36-hour all-nighter), I decided to participate in my first ever hackathon along with a few friends: Ritaj, Ram, and Katherine. The theme of the hackathon was to solve a <red style="color:red;">Canadian</red> <white style="color: white;">Issue</white>. Our project was a web applciation which connects the older generation to young individuals in order to help out with menial tasks such as shoveling snow off their sidewalks in exchange for volunteer hours as well as <careage style="color: #316cb8;">CareAge</careage> points which can be used to redeem different prizes. We decided to create the backend using the <flask style="color: rgb(0, 178, 178);">Flask</flask> module in <yellow style="color: yellow;">Py</yellow><blue style="color: #4B8BBE;">thon</blue> and coordinate it with a <blue style="color: rgb(0, 178, 178);">TypeScript/React</blue> frontend along with <sqlite3blue style="color: #0073CF;">SQLite3</sqlite3blue> for the databases, which can easily be migrated into <sqlite3blue style="color: #0073CF;">MySQL</sqlite3blue> in a professional hardcore environment. In the end, while we may not have won the hackathon, I enjoyed my time there and learned valuable skills such as <blue style="color: rgb(0, 178, 178);">React, Docker</blue>, AI, Blockchain, Orkes Conductor, Vercel, as well as the power of collaboration.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 5%; font-size: 1.5vw;">On March 21st, 2025 (21st to 23rd, 36-hour all-nighter), I decided to participate in my second ever hackathon; GenAI Genesis 2025, Canada's Largest AI Hackathon with over 2100 registrants, 600 hackers, and 160 projects. For this Hackathon, I had the opportunity to team up with Cayden Wong, Mahan Nourhosseinalipour, Tommy Yu. The theme and goal of this hackathon was to use AI for Human Empowerment. Our project was an improved email client which uses a specialized model to detect spam and scam, while discarding them accordingly. This would solve the ever-growing problem currently of malicious content online which are sent through emails such as phishing attacks. With our access to emails, we were also able to develop and incorporate additional functionality for users such as a built-in summary feature which can summarize the contents of your emails and provide personalized messages such as messages reminding you to reply or look at urgent emails, as well as a feature which allows the user to create a folder accompanied by a descriptor sentence allowing our AI model to categorize the emails into different folders based on similarity to the descriptor sentences. This project was built with a similar tech stack to some of my other projects, utilizing <flask style="color: rgb(0, 178, 178);">Flask</flask> in <yellow style="color: yellow;">Py</yellow><blue style="color: #4B8BBE;">thon</blue> for the backend, coordinating it with a <blue style="color: rgb(0, 178, 178);">TypeScript/React</blue> frontend, and <sqlite3blue style="color: #0073CF;">SQLite3</sqlite3blue> for databases. For our AI models, we used <cohere style="color: #1CAA96;">Cohere</cohere>'s pre-made models and fine tuned prompts, however with extra time and resources, a definite future plan would be to have a local model for specialized and more accurate results as well as for privacy reasons.</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 5%; font-size: 1.5vw;">On April 3rd, 2025, I decided to participate in my third ever hackathon; EurekaHacks 2025, Canada's Largest High School Hackathon with over 300 registrants/hackers, and 50 projects. For this Hackathon, I had the opportunity to team up with Pranav Bailoor, one of my best friends, and fellow student of Port Credit Secondary School. The theme of this hackathon was Outdoors. In order to come up with an idea, we went outdoors into the real world and asked people on the street in the surroundings. Their answer was almost always that they want to go out but they do not know where to go, and if they do, it takes time which they do not have to plan out the trip. We developed the solution in 8 hours; Roamify, your perzonalized AI trip planner encouraging people to connect with their natural surroundings. We utilize the Google Maps API in order to find visitors attractions in a nearby area, and create an AI generated plan courtesy of Gemini, which is shown to the user. This project was built with a similar tech stack to some of my other projects, utilizing <flask style="color: rgb(0, 178, 178);">Flask</flask> in <yellow style="color: yellow;">Py</yellow><blue style="color: #4B8BBE;">thon</blue> for the backend, basic HTML and CSS for the frontend, with <span class="genai-genesis">Google Gemini</span>'s pre-made models and fine tuned prompts, however with extra time and resources, a definite future plan would be to have a local model for specialized and more accurate results, not to mention quicker and more efficient results, as well as for privacy reasons, another future plan would be to have better location tracking and to save the user's preferences in terms of location for training and personalization.</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 5%; font-size: 1.5vw;">On May 16th 2025, I participated in my fourth hackathon experience; <span style="color: #d97ad9;">JamHacks 9</span>, Canada's New Largest High School Hackathon with over 200 registrants/hackers, and 60 projects. For this Hackathon, I teamed up with Devansh Goyal, a Grade 12 Student at Port Credit Secondary School this year, as well as Clare Chen, a Grade 10 at Laurel Heights Secondary School. The problem we decided to tackle was one which is quite prevalent and disturbing, especially in Canada and Ontario specifically. In Canada, 1 in 7 Emergency Room visits and can be solved in a general practice clinic, with more unaccounted for. This causes unnecessarily long wait times for something which is considered "emergency", this causes many Canadian citizens to travel to the US or other countries to receive the care they require for life. This is the problem my partners and I decided to solve this hackathon. We built CiviClinic, which is a platform which utilizes the raw power of <span style="color: #FF6B6B;">AI</span> as well as the authenticity of real doctors. It's a platform where patients can enter their symptoms or scan an image and receive tailored advice using our custom-built and trained <span style="color: #EE82EE;">machine learning models</span> for <span style="color: #9370DB;">image classification</span> as well as <span style="color: #9370DB;">Natural Language Processing</span>. In addition, users can also use our specialized map in order to find doctors, specialists, and general hospitals nearby using the <span style="color: #34A853;">Google Maps API</span>. We built this app using <span style="color: #EE4C2C;">PyTorch</span> for the <span style="color: #EE82EE;">Machine Learning models</span>, <span style="color: #003B57;">SQLite3</span> for the Databases, <flask style="color: rgb(0, 178, 178);">Flask</flask> in <yellow style="color: yellow;">Py</yellow><blue style="color: #4B8BBE;">thon</blue> for the backend and decided to take it slow with a vanilla <span style="color: #E34C26;">HTML</span>, <span style="color: #2965F1;">CSS</span>, and <span style="color: #F0DB4F;">JS</span> frontend.</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 5%; font-size: 1.5vw;">
On July 4th, 2025, I participated in my fifth ever hackathon; <span style="color: #008B8B; font-weight: bold;">Hack404</span>, a hackathon held by the Power Unit Youth Organization at University of Toronto's Myhal Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship with more than 220 participants and 45 projects submitted. For this hackathon, I teamed up with Devansh Goel, Farhan Naeem, and Yichen Xiao. We decided to build <span style="color: #3CB371; font-weight: bold;">Sweepify</span>, the <span style="color: #FF0000;">Pokemon GO</span> for <span style="color: #8B4513;">Trash</span> where one man's trash is another man's treasure. We built an app where users can upload an image of a dirty and trashy area onto our platform where we will use a machine learning model to give it a score of dirtiness, the higher the score the more trash. This picture will then be posted to a map where other users can clean up the trash, send in an after picture and be rewarded points for their service. These points can then be redeemed for prizes like gift cards, donations, sustainable items and so on. Another aspect of this app in terms of incentives is that we have a daily streak as well as friend nominations, a similar idea to <span style="color: #FFD700;">Snapchat</span> but for trash collection. We have numerous factors for verification to make sure that the users are not gaming the system such as <span style="color: #4169E1;">GPS tracking</span> of the user, a <span style="color: #FF6347;">30 minute cooldown</span>, a mandatory verification of cleanup, as well as an <span style="color: #8B0000;">ID required for sign up</span>. We also have additional features where users can schedule events such as a <span style="color: #9932CC;">mass cleanup</span>, as well as a <span style="color: #FF0000;">heatmap</span> of local hotspots which utilizes the <span style="color: #20B2AA;">OpenAI API</span> to scrape for recent hotspots. In order to develop this app, we utilized <span style="color: #61DAFB;">React</span>, <span style="color: #3178C6;">TypeScript</span>, and <span style="color: #38B2AC;">Tailwind CSS</span> for the frontend, <span style="color: #FFA500;">Firebase</span> for the databases, <span style="color: #000000;">Flask</span> for the backend and a variety of <span style="color: #4B0082;">APIS</span> such as the <span style="color: #4285F4;">Google Maps API</span>, <span style="color: #FF6B6B;">Roboflow API</span>, and <span style="color: #20B2AA;">OpenAI API</span>.

        Computer Engineering: One of the best courses I opted to take in high school was Grade 11 Computer Engineering. This class taught me valuable technical skills thanks to the adventurous nature of building projects rather than pen and paper studying. In this class, we were had to install and use <span style="color: #86BE43;">Linux</span> as our main operating system and contribute to programming projects, which led us to learn the command line interface as well as the inner workings of <span style="color: #f14e32;">Git</span>. One of the best projects that I had the opportunity of working on was to develop a tachometer for a broken treadmill using an infrared sensor, an 8-bit display and an <span style="color: rgb(0, 183, 169);">Arduino</span>. This gave me a chance to work on my problem-solving skills as well as my coding skills which can be found on display with the link below.
