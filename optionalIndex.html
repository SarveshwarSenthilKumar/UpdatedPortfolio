It also has a built-in game which was played by the class every day at the end of the day. There were two more installments to this series with Passion 2, being a personal goal where I learned <span class="orange">Ja</span><span class="Wb">va</span>, and Passion 3 where I decided to tackle the challenge of creating Rock Paper Scissors, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Battleship. This website was presented in front of the entire school and was played by numerous students.</p>

            <p>On February 21st, 2025 (21st to 23rd, 36-hour all-nighter), I decided to participate in my first ever hackathon along with a few friends: Ritaj, Ram, and Katherine. The theme of the hackathon was to solve a <span class="red">Canadian</span> <span class="white">Issue</span>. Our project was a web application which connects the older generation to young individuals in order to help out with menial tasks such as shoveling snow off their sidewalks in exchange for volunteer hours as well as <span class="careage">CareAge</span> points which can be used to redeem different prizes. We decided to create the backend using the <span class="flask">Flask</span> module in <span class="yellow">Py</span><span class="blue">thon</span> and coordinate it with a <span class="blue">TypeScript/React</span> frontend along with <span class="sqlite3blue">SQLite3</span> for the databases, which can easily be migrated into <span class="sqlite3blue">MySQL</span> in a professional production environment. In the end, while we may not have won the hackathon, I enjoyed my time there and learned valuable skills such as <span class="blue">React, Docker</span>, AI, Blockchain, Orkes Conductor, Vercel, as well as the power of collaboration.</p>

            <p>On March 21st, 2025 (21st to 23rd, 36-hour all-nighter), I decided to participate in my second ever hackathon; GenAI Genesis 2025, Canada's Largest AI Hackathon with over 2100 registrants, 600 hackers, and 160 projects. For this Hackathon, I had the opportunity to team up with Cayden Wong, Mahan Nourhosseinalipour, Tommy Yu. The theme and goal of this hackathon was to use AI for Human Empowerment. Our project was an improved email client which uses a specialized model to detect for spam and scam, while discarding of them accordingly. This would solve the evergrowing problem currently of malicious content online which are sent through emails such as phishing attacks. With our access to emails, we were also able to develop and incorporate additional functionality for users such as a built-in summary feature which can summarize the contents of your emails and provide personalized messages such as messages reminding you to reply or look at urgent emails, as well as a feature which allows the user to create a folder accompanied by a descriptor sentence allowing our AI model to categorize the emails into different folders based on similarity to the descriptor sentences. This project was built with a similar tech stack to some of my other projects, utilizing <span class="flask">Flask</span> in <span class="yellow">Py</span><span class="blue">thon</span> for the backend, coordinating it with a <span class="blue">TypeScript/React</span> frontend, and <span class="sqlite3blue">SQLite3</span> for databases. For our AI models, we used <span class="cohere">Cohere</span>'s pre-made models and fine tuned prompts, however with extra time and resources, a definite future plan would be to have a local model for specialized and more accurate results as well as for privacy reasons.</p>

            <p>On April 3rd, 2025, I decided to participate in my third ever hackathon; EurekaHacks 2025, Canada's Largest High School Hackathon with over 300 registrants/hackers, and 50 projects. For this Hackathon, I had the opportunity to team up with Pranav Bailoor, one of my best friends, and fellow student of Port Credit Secondary School. The theme of this hackathon was Outdoors. In order to come up with an idea, we went outdoors into the real world and asked people on the street in the surroundings. Their answer was almost always that they 3want to go out but they do not know where to go, and if they do, it takes time which they do not have to plan out the trip. We developed the solution in 8 hours; Roamify, your perzonalized AI trip planner encouraging people to connect with their natural surroundings. We utilize the Google Maps API in order to find visitors attractions in a nearby area, and create an AI generated plan courtesy of Gemini, which is shown to the user. This project was built with a similar tech stack to some of my other projects, utilizing <span class="flask">Flask</span> in <span class="yellow">Py</span><span class="blue">thon</span> for the backend, basic HTML and CSS for the frontend, with <span class="genai-genesis">Google Gemini</span>'s pre-made models and fine tuned prompts, however with extra time and resources, a definite future plan would be to have a local model for specialized and more accurate results, not to mention quicker and more efficient results, as well as for privacy reasons, another future plan would be to have better location tracking and to save the user's preferences in terms of location for training and personalization.</p>

          <p>One of the best courses I opted to take in high school was Grade 11 Computer Engineering. This class taught me valuable technical skills thanks to the adventurous nature of building projects rather than pen and paper studying. In this class, we were had to install and use <span style="color: #86BE43;">Linux</span> as our main operating system and contribute to programming projects, which led us to learn the command line interface as well as the inner workings of <span style="color: #f14e32;">Git</span>. One of the best projects that I had the opportunity of working on was to develop a tachometer for a broken treadmill using an infrared sensor, an 8-bit display and an <span class="arduino">Arduino</span>. This gave me a chance to work on my problem-solving skills as well as my coding skills which can be found on display with the link below.</p>

                <p>On March 21st, 2025 (21st to 23rd, 36-hour all-nighter), I decided to participate in my second ever hackathon; GenAI Genesis 2025, Canada's Largest AI Hackathon with over 2100 registrants, 600 hackers, and 160 projects. For this Hackathon, I had the opportunity to team up with Cayden Wong, Mahan Nourhosseinalipour, Tommy Yu. The theme and goal of this hackathon was to use AI for Human Empowerment. Our project was an improved email client which uses a specialized model to detect spam and scam, while discarding them accordingly. This would solve the ever-growing problem currently of malicious content online which are sent through emails such as phishing attacks. With our access to emails, we were also able to develop and incorporate additional functionality for users such as a built-in summary feature which can summarize the contents of your emails and provide personalized messages such as messages reminding you to reply or look at urgent emails, as well as a feature which allows the user to create a folder accompanied by a descriptor sentence allowing our AI model to categorize the emails into different folders based on similarity to the descriptor sentences. This project was built with a similar tech stack to some of my other projects, utilizing <span class="flask">Flask</span> in <span class="yellow">Py</span><span class="blue">thon</span> for the backend, coordinating it with a <span class="blue">TypeScript/React</span> frontend, and <span class="sqlite3blue">SQLite3</span> for databases. For our AI models, we used <span class="cohere">Cohere</span>'s pre-made models and fine tuned prompts, however with extra time and resources, a definite future plan would be to have a local model for specialized and more accurate results as well as for privacy reasons.</p>

                <p>On April 3rd, 2025, I decided to participate in my third ever hackathon; EurekaHacks 2025, Canada's Largest High School Hackathon with over 300 registrants/hackers, and 50 projects. For this Hackathon, I had the opportunity to team up with Pranav Bailoor, one of my best friends, and fellow student of Port Credit Secondary School. The theme of this hackathon was Outdoors. In order to come up with an idea, we went outdoors into the real world and asked people on the street in the surroundings. Their answer was almost always that they want to go out but they do not know where to go, and if they do, it takes time which they do not have to plan out the trip. We developed the solution in 8 hours; Roamify, your personalized AI trip planner encouraging people to connect with their natural surroundings. We utilize the Google Maps API in order to find visitors attractions in a nearby area, and create an AI generated plan courtesy of Gemini, which is shown to the user. This project was built with a similar tech stack to some of my other projects, utilizing <span class="flask">Flask</span> in <span class="yellow">Py</span><span class="blue">thon</span> for the backend, basic HTML and CSS for the frontend, with <span class="genai-genesis">Google Gemini</span>'s pre-made models and fine tuned prompts, however with extra time and resources, a definite future plan would be to have a local model for specialized and more accurate results, not to mention quicker and more efficient results, as well as for privacy reasons, another future plan would be to have better location tracking and to save the user's preferences in terms of location for training and personalization.</p>

I was responsible for all the software development for this project, such as the website, and I had the chance to showcase a lot of projects including the Passion 3 above and HackerLife below.

        <p>One of the best courses I opted to take in high school was Grade 11 Computer Engineering. This class taught me valuable technical skills thanks to the adventurous nature of building projects rather than pen and paper studying. In this class, we were had to install and use <span style="color: #86BE43;">Linux</span> as our main operating system and contribute to programming projects, which led us to learn the command line interface as well as the inner workings of <span style="color: #f14e32;">Git</span>. One of the best projects that I had the opportunity of working on was to develop a tachometer for a broken treadmill using an infrared sensor, an 8-bit display and an <span class="arduino">Arduino</span>. This gave me a chance to work on my problem-solving skills as well as my coding skills which can be found on display with the link below.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">I am a person who enjoys honing my problem-solving skills as can be seen by my two biggest passions of Computer Science and Chess. I also believe that my strength lies in my collaboration and communications skills as proven by my collaborative projects like <span class="darkgreen">Re</span><span class="golden">Sourced</span> and my marketing and public projects such as <a href="https://zugzwangcc.wordpress.com" style="color: yellow;">Zugzwang</a> as well as Auto<span class="green">Box</span>.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">I am grateful for the opportunities I have had leading up to the present and for the projects that had led me to build up the skillset and experience I have currently, and I am looking forward to the future and wherever it leads me.
